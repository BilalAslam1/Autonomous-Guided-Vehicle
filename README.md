# Autonomous-Guided-Vehicle
The purpose of this project was to simulate a factory AGV as it goes around an industrial plant. MechBot and EV Shield programs were made to talk to each other. An automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle (AGV) is a portable robot that follows markers or wires in the floor, or uses vision, magnets, or lasers for navigation. They are most often used in industrial applications to move materials around a manufacturing facility or warehouse. MechBot is a smaller version of an AGV which was used for our project.

## Sensors:
* NXT cam (tracks up to 8 colored objects or line)
* Servo Motors
* Ev Shield
* Mechbot
